## Project Description
This repostiory hosts the group assignment for the COMP3104 Devops course
with a focus on practical implementation of core DevOps principles.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Switch to your branch using 'git checkout STUDENTID-Name'
3. Install all dependencies as listed
4. All members should create a branch base off from main
5. Make 10 commits with meaningful messages
6. Update Readme file
7. Merge all branches to main
8. Create pull request template file
9. Commit and push template
10. Submit a PDF file with the above mentioned process

## Collaborative git workflows
1. The project requires students to work collaboratively using Git version
control system.
2. Emphasis on feature branching, pull requests, and code review to manage
changes efficiently
3. Students will follow best practices for branching strategies such as
GitFlow or GitHub Flow to maintain a clean and manageable proejct history

## Branching Strategies
1. The repostiory will utilize structured branching models and manage development
2. Each member has their own branch named 'STUDENTID-firstName-LastName' All changes are merged into the 'main' branch via pull request

## Continuous Integreation/Continuous Deployment(CI/CD) Integreation
1. The assignment incorporates CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions
2. The goal is to automate the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring code quality and reducing manual intervention.

## Testing & Code Quality
1. Automated testing suites will be integrated into the CI/CD piplelines to check for regressions and verify the functionality of new features
2. Code linting and stle checks may be enforced as part of the workflow to 
maintain consistent code quality throughout the project.
