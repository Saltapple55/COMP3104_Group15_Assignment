## Project Description
This repostiory hosts the group assignment for the COMP3104 Devops course
with a focus on practical implementation of core DevOps principles.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Switch to your branch using 'git checkout STUDENTID-Name'
3. Install all dependencies as listed

## Collaborative git workflows
1. The project requires students to work collaboratively using Git version
control system.
2. Emphasis on feature branching, pull requests, and code review to manage
changes efficiently
3. Students will follow best practices for branching strategies such as
GitFlow or GitHub Flow to maintain a clean and manageable proejct history

## Branching Strategies
1.The repostiory will utilize structured branching models and manage development
2.Strategies such as feature branches, development branches, hotfix branches,
and release branches will be implemented

## Continuous Integreation/Continuous Deployment(CI/CD) Integreation
1. The assignment incorporates CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins,
GitLab CI, Travis CI, or GitHub Actions
2. The goal is to automate the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring code quality and reducing manual intervention.

## Testing & Code Quality
1. Automated testing suites will be integrated into the CI/CD piplelines to check for regressions and verify the functionality of new features
2. Code linting and stle checks may be enforced as part of the workflow to 
maintain consistent code quality throughout the project.
