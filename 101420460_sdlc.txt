This is the software development life cycle document. 

There are two types of SDLCs: Agile and Waterfall. 
Waterfall development is a more traditional method of development, where all stages happen in order.
It is, however, inefficient because its less likely to be able to adjust to changes. 

Most successful companies use agile development, which take the steps of the development cycle as not a ladder to climb, but a cycle, continuously updating each part.
